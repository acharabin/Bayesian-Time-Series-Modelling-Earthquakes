# Bayesian-Time-Series-Modelling-Earthquakes

Project for the Bayesian Statistics: Time Series Analysis course at UC Santa Cruz.

The objective of this report is to model yearly earthquakes using a Bayesian AR model fit using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

See the [report](https://github.com/acharabin/Bayesian-Time-Series-Modelling-Earthquakes/blob/main/Bayesian%20AR%20Modelling%20of%20Yearly%20Earthquake%20Volumes.pdf
) for further details.
